# Six_Sigma_Statistics
Working through the different statistical tests needed for a six sigma project. Specifically I am working throug the Six Sigma: a complete step by step guide circulated at the start of furlough and working through the statistical tests in python using Numpy and SciPy libraries.

Overview of code files:
 - Measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation, Bessel correction, long method, short method (pandas, numpy or Scipy))
